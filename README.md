# SampleNewsApp_swift

This project is a Swift-based implementation inspired by the "Geek Time"-style app-building tutorial.  
While the original tutorial was written in Objective-C, this version is fully rewritten in Swift.  
It aims to demonstrate how to build an app from 0 to 1 using modern Swift best practices.
